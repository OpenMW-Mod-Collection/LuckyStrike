Luck-based crits for everyone!

_For an MWSE alternative, check out [Lucky Strike - a Critical Hit Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45765) by R-Zero._

Everyone (both you and your enemies) now has a chance to deal critical hits based on their Luck attribute.

## Formulas

### Crtical hit chance formulas

> **Linear:** (Luck \* LuckMult + BackstabBonus + BaseChance) / 100  
> **Classic:** (Luck / 100) ^ 3 / 2

Note: backstabbing is based purely on victim's FOV and not on vanilla visibility.

### Critical hit damage multiplier formula

> (WeaponSpeed \* SpeedMult + WeaponSkill \* SkillMult) \* BaseMult / 100
