# Lucky Strike (OpenMW)

Luck-based crits for everyone!

_Effectively an OpenMW port of R-Zero's MWSE [Lucky Strike - a Critical Hit Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45765)._

Everyone (both you and your enemies) now will have a chance to deal critical hits based on their Luck attribute.

## Formulas

### Crtical hit chance formula

> (Luck / 100) ^ 3 / 2

Meaning, with 40 starting Luck your Crit Chance would be around 3%

### Critical hit damage formula

> BaseDamage \* BaseCritMult \* WeaponSpeed

Weapon speed varies from 1 (for most weapons) to 2.5 (daggers).
